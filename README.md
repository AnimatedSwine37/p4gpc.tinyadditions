A Reloaded-II mod that adds small QOL features to Persona 4 Golden PC

This is currently **very WIP** and only detects keyboard input and displays it to the console. Much more work needs to be done into reading controller input as well as reading input for buttons that the game usually doesn't use.

In the future this will hopefully contain features such as "sprint", infinite Persona switching, Persona 5 like battle shortcuts (like Y opening skills) and more. 
**These are all just ideas, there is no guarantee any of these things actually get made**
