A Reloaded-II mod that adds small QOL features to Persona 4 Golden PC

This is currently **very WIP** and only detects keyboard and controller input and displays it to the console. The mod doesn't actually do anything with that yet.

In the future this will hopefully contain features such as "sprint", infinite Persona switching, Persona 5 like battle shortcuts (like Y opening skills) and more. 
**These are all just ideas, there is no guarantee any of these things actually get made**
