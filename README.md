A Reloaded-II mod that adds small QOL features to Persona 4 Golden PC

This is currently **WIP** it currently can read controller and keyboard input (excluding joysticks and mouse clicks). Using this you can "sprint" by pressing circle which can be adjusted in the config along with how much of a speed increase you get. 

In the future this will hopefully contain more features such as infinite Persona switching, Persona 5 like battle shortcuts (like Y opening skills) and more. 
**These are all just ideas, there is no guarantee any of these things actually get made**
