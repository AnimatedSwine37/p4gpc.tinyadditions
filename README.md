# p4gpc.tinyadditions
A WIP Reloaded-II mod that adds a collection of small QOL features to Persona 4 Golden PC

## Current Additions
All of the features currently implemented are listed below. Each addition can be toggled on or off in the mod's configuration in Reloaded. By default all additions are enabled.

### Sprint
Allows the player to "sprint", increasing their movement speed by a set amount. The amount that the speed is increased by and the sprint button can be changed in the mod's config. There is also an optional setting that makes sprint only available whilst exploring dungeons. The default sprint button is the back button (circle/b/c).

### Auto Advance Text Toggle
Allows the player to toggle the auto advance text setting during events similarly to P5R. This comes into effect from the next text box that is displayed. By default this is done by pressing down on the dpad (or s/down arrow on keyboard) during an event. This can be changed in the mod's config.

### Easy Bug Catching
Makes it so the player always gets a perfect catch when catching bugs at the shrine regardless of how you time it.

## Planned Additions
These are features that I would like to add however, there is no guarantee that any of them every actually happen. If you want to have a crack at implementing one of these then go for it! (more info in [contributing](#contributing)) 

### Persona 5 Battle Enhancements
Make P4G's battle system implement some of the enhancements in P5 such as the button shortcuts and infinite Persona switching. A lot of work on this has already been done by Rirurin, however, idk if it will be combined into this mod or made into a seperate one.

### Automatic Arcana Bonus On NG+
Make it so the player always gets the social link Arcana bonuses if they have a s.link's max rank item. This would need to be combined with a flowscript mod do get the text correct however, the actual mechanic of increasing points gained if you have a Persona of a matcching Arcana appears to be hardcoded, hence the need for a Reloaded mod. More research needs to be done into this to tell whether it's actually hardcoded.

### More Things
There are undoubtedly many other things you could do to P4G that would require Reloaded to do. If you have any good ideas feel free to create an issue explaining them and I (and anyone else who wants to) may make it assuming it isn't completely unrealistic and is interesting.

## Contributing
Any and all contributions are welcome and appreciated whether you want to add a new feature, edit an existing one or anything else. Try to keep code and commits relatively clean, however, as long as it isn't atrociously bad I will more than likely accept any pull requests.
